* Why

For when you and your friends can't decide where to eat. This applies
a similar approach to tinder but for finding an agreed upon place to eat.

* WARNING

This is an active work in progress. Expect regular breaking changes

* Running this project
** Haskell versioning
Haskell tooling is a little picky on versioning so be sure to use
[[https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/][GHCup]] to ensure you are using the correct versions.
#+begin_src bash
  ghcup set ghc 9.4.8
  ghcup set cabal 3.10.2.1
  ghcup set hls 2.5.0.0 # for dev
#+end_src
** Running Tender
You will need a [[https://www.yelp.com/developers/v3/manage_app][Yelp API key]]

To run this project export the API key as shown and execute default
make targets for both the front and backend

#+begin_src sh
  export YELP_KEY="<your-key-here>"
  cd frontend
  make
  cd ..
  cd backend
  make
#+end_src

This will start both the front and backend for you
